If you're experiencing issues with the "Guess the Capital" application on your local computer, let's try to troubleshoot it:




###
Check Local Server Setup:

Ensure you have Python installed on your local machine. You can verify this by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your application files are located using the terminal or command prompt.
Start the Local Server:

Run the command python -m http.server or python3 -m http.server in the terminal. This will start a local server on port 8000 by default.
Access the Application:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. This should display your application.

Inspect for Errors:

If the options are still not showing, open the Developer Tools in your browser (usually accessible by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or pressing Ctrl+Shift+I).
Check the "Console" tab for any error messages that might indicate what's going wrong.
Verify File Integrity:

Ensure all necessary files are present in the directory. Double-check your HTML and JavaScript files for any missing or incorrect references.
Clear Cache and Refresh:

Clear your browser cache and refresh the page to ensure you're loading the most recent version of your files.
If these steps don't resolve the issue, please let me know any specific error messages or behaviors you're observing, and we can troubleshoot further.
